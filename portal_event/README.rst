==============
 Portal Event
==============

Allows to customers see tickets for events at Portal.


The module to depends on ``website_event_attendee_signup`` module:

* partner_id is considered to be a person who attends (out-of-box is a person bought the ticket)
* obviously, only signuped users can use portal

website_portal_event
--------------------

The module is not splitted in two (e.g. portal_event and website_portal_event) as it's usually done, because since 11.0 there is no such separation.
