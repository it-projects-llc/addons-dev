Other operations via barcode scanner
------------------------------------

It's possible to do whole process via barcode scanner only (no mouse, no keyboard, no touchscreen, no whatever). In order to do that, you need to have printed *command barcodes* that contains text code, rather than a product number. List of code and their operations are following:

* O-CMD.INV     - ``[Start Inventory]``
* O-CMD.VALID   - ``[Validate Inventory]``
* O-CMD.SAVE    - ``[Save]`` the inventory

* O-CMD.NEW     - ``[Create]`` new inventory
* O-CMD.EDIT    - ``[Edit]`` inventory

* O-CMD.DISCARD - ``[Discard]`` changes
* O-CMD.CANCEL  - ``[Cancel Inventory]``
* O-CMD.NEXT    - Next inventory in a row
* O-CMD.PREV    - Previous inventory in a row

You can make those barcodes in any barcode generation tool or use prepared ones from ``doc/command-barcodes/`` folder
