Must be Odoo V9.0 compatible.

When the customer is ready to checkout I would like for there to be three additional
options: "Pickup and pay at store", "Pay now and get delivery", and "Pickup at store
but pay now".

If it's possible the Pickup and pay at store option would disable the
billing information but require a name, phone number, and email address.

The Pickup at store but pay now would continue through the pay online process but not include
shipping information.

All options would create a Sales Order that alerts the company
there is an order. The "Pay now and get delivery" option will just use usual workflow.

Finally, on the admin side there would be an addition to the configuration page where
they would enable or disable one or both of these options.
