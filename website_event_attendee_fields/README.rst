 Customizable fields for attendees on Events
=============================================

By default ``website_event`` module asks only three fields to fill about attendees (name, email, phone). This module allows to customize any set of fields.

Also,

* if total bootstrap width of field columns is more that 12

  * hides Header at Attendee form
  * shows field name above each input

* If user is authenticated:

  * first attendee at the form will have autofilled values (if person is not registered yet)

* When email column is presented and there is a partner with that email:

  * if partner has registration for the event:

    * registration is blocked. Warning is shown

  * if partner has some of fields

    * grey them out with a message "This email address already has an account. Data will be taken from this account"

* Modifies behaviour of ``event_partner`` module:

  * always updates Registration's name and phone to corresponded values of Attendee Partner, because they be taken from Partner record (e.g. Public User)

Demo mode
---------
In demo installation:

* on installation each Event gets standarts fields (Name, Email, Phone) and two fields from partner (Country, Job Position)
